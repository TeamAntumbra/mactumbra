Glow app for OS X - 

Quickstart

Plug in your glows and then launch the app.
Your glow should go from dim green to bright white when the app launches.  The app is accessible via the antumbra icon in the status menu bar.  

Screen mirror guide:

1. Click on the mirror tab and click the settings button;

2. Adjust the colored window(s) such that they fit over the content you want the glow to project.
For example, if you are watching a small quicktime movie, move the blue settings window over the quicktime movie. Larger areas will utilize more processing power and memory.  

3. After you have adjusted the settings window, select a mirror mode:

  -Mirror: averages the colors from the area covered by the blue window;
  
  -Augment : same as mirror but also boosts color saturation, good for gaming and movies;
  
  -Smooth: same as mirror but no rapid color changes, good for daily usage;
